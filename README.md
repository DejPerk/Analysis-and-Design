What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?  
I decided to use the module four assignment hash tables. For this assignment I was finding software to help computer science advisors access course information for students. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
When starting the task I created a pseudocode to give myself an idea of how I want the software to operate. Once I started I changed it a few times in order to get a layout that would show the correct order in which the software should read the code and produce the correct output. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I know this code had errors in the output BUT I had an output. I was up late going back and forth with tutors who were also just as confused as I was, but I was getting further than I was before. I know that first I was once again stumped on the error “not found in path” but was fixed by making sure the C++ was in path after finding it within the toolchains. Then this was followed by “cannot convert string to const char*” because I was trying to pass a string where a C-style string was expected. But with the help of the tutors and looking over zybooks I fixed all the errors to produce an output.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
The work on this project, including the others, has shown me I need to keep practicing whether it be school work practice where I go over material or doing some personal programs to understand different elements. Being able to sit and focus has always been a challenge for me especially since I have found myself to be a kinesthetic learner. I just need to find a routine where I can have more physical activities with others in order to get immediate feedback and in person explanations.  

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
First off, each project has made me realize that I need to keep asking questions and review material sooner so that I don't find myself stumped and stressed. Second, I know that I have to lay out a plan when creating a program even if I write it down or just add actual code to my pseudocode so I can easily backtrack mistakes/ errors. Another thing is for me I need to add comments that are more in detail for my understanding while breaking my code down into smaller sections like the assignments had me doing. Breaking down the assignment code helped layout the final project making it a bit easier to manage along with any adjustments that were needed.
